  ## Description

An innovative social media backend app powered by MongoDB, designed for seamless user interactions. It efforlessly manages user profiles, posts, comments, friends, and reactions while ensuring flexibility. The app leverages MongoDB's NoSQL capabilities to store and retrieve data rapidly, providing a responsive and dynamic social experience.

In its current state, there is no frontend for the app, so the user would need to use Insomnia to test the routes and access their database.
